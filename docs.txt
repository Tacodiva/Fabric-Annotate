This package deals with all the logic behind registries.

At it's heart, a registry is just a collection of entries which all have
Identifiers. The registry itself also has an identifier. A registry must be
annotated with {@link sh.emberj.annotate.registry.Registry @Registry} and
implement {@link sh.emberj.annotate.registry.IRegistry IRegistry}. An entry
can be added to a registry in three different ways. 

1. Using the @Register annotation takes in the identifier of the registry and
 will create an instance of whatever type it's on and add it to that registry.

2. Implementing the IRegisterable interface on an annotated type will create
 an instance of whatever type is implementing it and add it to the registry
 returned by the getRegistry method.

3. Adding it to the registry directly by using the @Instance annotation on the
 registry or whatever.
